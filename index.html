        <h3>Professional Profile</h3>
        <p>
          I am a third-year Business Chinese student at Foreign Trade University
          with a solid foundation in Chinese language and business-related subjects.
          Through my academic training, I have developed strong skills in
          business communication, document analysis, and basic translation
          between Chinese and Vietnamese.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am particularly interested in international trade, cross-border
          business communication, and working in multicultural environments.
          My academic background has helped me build a professional mindset,
          attention to detail, and the ability to adapt quickly to new tasks.

        <h3>Academic & Practical Experience</h3>
        <p>
          During my studies, I have completed multiple coursework projects related
          to business Chinese, including analysis of commercial texts, translation
          exercises, and case studies on international trade practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, I have experience working with Chinese-language materials
          such as contracts, emails, and business reports, which has strengthened
          my understanding of professional terminology and formal writing styles.
